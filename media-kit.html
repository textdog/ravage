                <p>Ravage is a film and performance artwork
                    featuring 30 customer service calls as a comedy
                    of manners. In this show you will see the art of
                    the phone, the phone call, loneliness, commutes
                    to work, and suburbia. Ravage is a
                    performance artwork of experimental jokes.

                    <p><strong>Recently awarded New Filmmakers NYC semi-
                    finalist.</strong></p>
                <h3>LOGLINE</h3>
                <p>Amid a small-town war, a mediocre call center
                contractor gets a suitcase for her fatuous small
                talk. The illogic of call scripts, customers, and
                petty workplace misconduct show us the grandeur of middle-ware.</p>
                <h3>FILM SUMMARY</h3>
                <p>In this not-fully-a-performance art video nor film, suburban discards find

                    themselves in mental disarray because the phone rings. Amid a small-
                    town war, a mediocre call center contractor gets a suitcase for her
                    
                    fatuous small talk. She meets a valued customer in person and are both
                    "on hold" for an afternoon because they expect the other to respond. It
                    seems like everyone is actually journaling in the back of their minds.</p>
                    <p>This rough-edged sketch mixing recontextualized unrelated footage and
                        performance is a study of American doofiness and unthinking set in
                        place by the corporate call script dessicant flourishing in our minds.
                        Despite people’s inability to recognize bullshit and parallel existence
                        even in close proximity, the world basically holds itself up and even
                        contractors find the freedom to live beyond what is given--to make the
                        in-between sublime, like only their logic or illogic can do. They are great
                        at living! Depression and joy can be directly attributed to the darkness
                        and play of customer service calls.</p>
